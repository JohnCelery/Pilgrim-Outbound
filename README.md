# Pilgrim Outbound  
*A zero-dependency browser roguelike set in 9ᵗʰ-century Europe*


---

## Setting  
AD 879.  Charlemagne’s empire has splintered, Viking longships menace every coast, and rumors of a coming plague drift on the trade winds.  
You are a battered royal courier who wakes in the aftermath of a raid, hundreds of leagues from home, holding a relic that could decide the fate of a kingdom.  With only a weary mount, a torn map, and a half-empty saddlebag, you must thread the fractured realms of Christendom, the pagan North, and the Muslim frontier to deliver your charge—or die unknown along the road.

## Core Fantasy  
* Total isolation on a dangerous medieval road network.  
* Hard choices about where to spend dwindling food, water, and gear integrity.  
* The constant lure of side-paths—ruined Roman forts, plague-stricken towns, secret pilgrim trails—that promise miracle rewards or instant ruin.  
* No restart checkpoints; death erases the run but leaves your abandoned baggage as a discoverable loot cache for the next attempt.

## How a Run Plays Out  

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. Chart the Route** | Study a parchment map dotted with monasteries, markets, and mountain passes.  Click a neighboring waypoint; the game previews the food & water cost and any known dangers. |
| **2. Pay the Price** | Spend provisions and water.  If either meter hits zero, the courier collapses. |
| **3. Face the Unknown** | On arrival, one or two narrative events roll: a Norse ambush, a kindly friar, a field surgeon demanding payment.  Short, choose-your-own-adventure snippets can grant supplies, damage gear, or branch into long mission arcs. |
| **4. Exploit the Locale** | Each node houses 0–4 resource sites: farms (grain), forests (herbs & wood), rivers (water & fish), mines (iron).  Spend tools and stamina to harvest, risking damage with each deeper dig. |
| **5. Repack & Craft** | Tetris-pack loot into the 6 × 4 saddlebag grid.  Recipes—taught by scholars or found in Roman ruins—let you forge upgrades (chainmail, compass, astrolabe) if the required pieces fit adjacent in the grid.  Better packing grants adjacency bonuses. |
| **6. Push On** | Check diary missions (six color-flagged “legends” that can end a run), pick the next waypoint, and repeat until you reach an ending— or run out of life support. |

A successful journey lasts 30–60 minutes.  Most fail in 10–20.

## Themes & Tone  
* **Solitude & Fatalism** – No party, no cavalry; the road itself is the antagonist.  
* **Syncretic Mysticism** – Miracles, omens, and science coexist; a Muslim scholar’s astrolabe is as valuable as a saint’s finger-bone.  
* **Determinism** – Every run is driven by a single seed; with perfect memory you could reproduce it move-for-move.  
* **Ephemeral Legacy** – Death wipes the slate, yet leaves ghostly traces: half-decoded languages, graves containing your previous gear, rumors travelers whisper about “the fallen rider.”

## Endgame Paths (When Complete)  
1. **Azure – Pax Romana**: escort the relic to Rome and secure papal sanction.  
2. **Vert – Seed of Yggdrasil**: ally with a Norse skald to plant a holy oak on pagan soil.  
3. **Or – House of Wisdom**: ferry four scholars to Córdoba to spark a new renaissance.  
4. **Gules – The Red Cross**: raise a refugee banner and break a siege.  
5. **Sable – The Black Plague**: venture into a quarantined city bearing a legendary cure—or join the darkness.  
6. **Argent – Homecoming**: thread treacherous borders to lay the relic at a dying king’s bedside.

Each legend unveils organically through events; pursuing one closes others, forcing a strategic narrative choice.

## The Promise  
When finished, *Pilgrim Outbound* will be a pick-up-and-die-trying browser game:  
clickable, readable, no installs, but deep enough that veterans will chase perfect runs, dissect seed patterns, and swap campfire stories of the one caravan that almost made it home.
