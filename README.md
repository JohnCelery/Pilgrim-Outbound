# Pilgrim Outbound

A zero-dependency browser roguelike set in the late 9th century. This repository currently contains only the skeleton needed to boot the game in a browser. Future pull requests will flesh out the engine, data tables and gameplay loops.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Everything runs client side with no build step or dependencies.
